Product & Customer Analytics Project Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive analysis of sales, product, and customer data to drive strategic business decisions. It encompasses the entire data analysis pipeline: Data Querying (SQL), Advanced Analytics (Python), and Interactive Visualization (Power BI).

 # Technologies Used

* Database & Querying: SQL (for complex joins, aggregations, and subqueries)

* Advanced Analytics: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, K-Means Clustering for RFM Segmentation)

* Visualization: Power BI (for interactive dashboards and KPI tracking)

# Key Project Components & Methodology

## SQL-based Product Performance Analysis:

* Developed and executed  advanced SQL queries (using Joins, Group By, Window Functions, etc.) to analyze Product Performance, Sales Trends, Customer Behavior, and Pricing Strategy.

* Deliverables: Total Sales by Region/Category, Product Profitability (Gross Margin%), High-Value Products, and Sales Velocity.

## Python-based Customer Segmentation:

* Implemented the Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) model on customer transaction data.

* Applied K-Means Clustering to segment customers into actionable groups (e.g., Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, New/Lapsed).

* Deliverables: Identified 4 distinct customer segments and exported the results for targeted marketing.

# Power BI Dashboard Development:

Created dynamic, interactive dashboards
focused on key business metrics. 
* Deliverables: Sales Overview (Revenue, Quantity Sold, Total Customers), Geographic Performance (Sales by Region), Product Deep-Dive (Category & Subcategory performance).

 # Key Business Insights & Recommendations
The analysis yielded several actionable insights crucial for optimizing sales and marketing strategies:

## 1. Product Performance & Inventory Optimization

* High-Profit Products: Products in the Clothing and Electronics categories are consistently top performers across multiple regions (e.g., Central India, North India), suggesting continued investment and focus.

* Gross Margin Focus: Products with the highest Gross Margin Percentage  are critical for profitability. Marketing efforts should prioritize these items to maximize returns.

* Low-Margin Review: Products with lower margins  should be reviewed for cost reduction or pricing adjustments to improve overall financial health.

2. Strategic Regional & Category Focus
South India Dominance: Stationery is the top-selling category in South India, while Clothing and Electronics lead in Central and North India. This highlights the need for region-specific inventory stocking and marketing campaigns.

* Opportunity in Furniture: Furniture consistently ranks as the lowest-selling category in all regions, indicating an area for potential category-specific promotional campaigns or product line review.

## 3. Actionable Customer Segmentation (RFM)

* Target the 'Champions': The Champions segment (High Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) should be rewarded with exclusive offers to ensure retention and maximize lifetime value.

* Win Back 'At Risk' Customers: The At Risk segment (Low Monetary/Frequency, but high Recency) needs immediate intervention with personalized re-engagement campaigns and loyalty incentives to prevent churn.
